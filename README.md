# Intro
  - a git repo manager
  - use case:
     + installation of vim packages in vims runtime environment
     + centralizing the management of all packages installed 
    
# TODO List:
 + database structure for keeping track of installed files
 + generalization of installation instructions
 + target directory management
 + uninstallation (directory based / so multiple instances can be created)
 + commit functionality ?
 + build system / build detection (not sure if it will work)
